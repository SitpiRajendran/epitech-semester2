via Makeﬁle, including re, clean and fclean rules

• Your repository must contain the totality of your source files, but no useless files
(binary, temp files, obj files,...).
• Error messages have to be written on the error output, and the program should
then exit with the 84 error code (0 if there is no error).

The $STUMPERNUMBER is always on one digit: 1, 2, . . .

For this project, the only authorized functions are those of the standard libC.

The goal of this exercise is to create a program in C that will allow you to simulate Pokemon fights.
The Pokemon to be used will be described in the files found in the pokecfg/ folder. The files will be formatted
in CSV with the following fields:
∇
Terminal
- + x
∼/B-CPE-210> cat -e pokecfg/pikachu
#name;attack;defense;speed;health$
Pikachu;42;42;42;42$
Raichu;84;20;84;84$
Your program should then read each file contained in the pokecfg/ folder in order to retrieve the information
for each Pokemon.
Lines beginning with "#" are comments and should be ignored. Also, each file can contain several Pokemon.
After having retrieved the information from the configuration files, your program should display the retrieved Pokemon and their stats in the following way:
Pokemon NAME has ATTACK attack, DEFENSE defense, SPEED speed and HEALTH health.

The displayed pokemon must be sorted by their names (case insensitive)
If a line is invalid, you must skip it and continue the parsing.

Next, you must pick the two Pokemon specified as parameter and simulate a fight between them.
Combat rules are as follow:
• The Pokemon take turns attacking
• The Pokemon that has the highest speed value starts
• A Pokemon attacks its opponent and tries to give an amount of damage between 0 and its attack
value
• The opposing Pokemon decreases the damage incurred by its defense value
• The health value of the Pokemon opponent is decreased from the remaining damages
• When a Pokemon’s health value is reduced to 0, he is KO and the fight is over
