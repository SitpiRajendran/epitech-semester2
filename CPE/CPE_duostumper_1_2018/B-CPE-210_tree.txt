• Your repository must contain the totality of your source files, but no useless files
(binary, temp files, obj files,...).

The $STUMPERNUMBER is always on one digit: 1, 2, . . .

For this project, the only authorized functions are write, malloc, free, opendir,
closedir, readdir and stat.

The goal of this exercise is to code a program in C that will reproduce the behavior of the tree shell command
when it’s used with the option --charset=ASCII.
You must implement the following options:
•
•
•
•

-a
-d
-L
-f

All of these options must be able to be combined and have a behavior that is identical to the original command.
Your error messages and exit codes must be identical to the real tree binary.
