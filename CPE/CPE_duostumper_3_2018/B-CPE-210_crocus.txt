via Makeﬁle, including re, clean and fclean rules

• Your repository must contain the totality of your source files, but no useless files
(binary, temp files, obj files,...).
• Error messages have to be written on the error output, and the program should
then exit with the 84 error code (0 if there is no error).

The $STUMPERNUMBER is always on one digit: 1, 2, . . .

For this project, the only authorized functions are those of the standard libC.

The Crocus Cafe is having a crisis: their receipt printer is broken.
After replacing it, they can no longer print the order numbers on the receipts. This is the cause of a an agonizing lack of organization during the lunch rush, when rather strange things can be witnessed.
To help them write a program that can print order numbers in a customizable way?
Usage: ./crocus -n number [-s string]
• -n number: the number to display in “ASCII art”, it must be >=0
• -s string: each digit will be represented by the character from string whose index
is the digit (modulo the size of string). Default: ’0’ (zero).
Here’s what your digits must look like:
